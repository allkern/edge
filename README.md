# edge
Edge-accurate Game Boy emulator written in C++


## Information
This is a Game Boy emulator on a REALLY early development stage aiming not only to achieve edge accuracy, but to implement most of the functionality of each individual pin, at least on the LR35902 SoC for now.

All of this requires a lot of hard work, documentation & schematics research, etc. and as such, will probably take a considerable amount of time to complete. Don't expect to find anything "usable" any time soon
